    go get github.com/pschultz/inodes

    $GOPATH/bin/inodes /home | sort -k1,1n -k 2,2r

Lists cumulative number of inodes in each directory in /home (recursively),
starting with the smallest tree

Results per directory might be of by one or so. I usually don't care if I want
to know where 120 million inodes are used.
